Visualization of a Black Hole Using Python and Blender:

In drawing the accurate representation of the black hole, one is required to simulate the effect of gravity on light and hence resulting to gravitational lensing effects. The gravitational force in a black hole is extremely high and this warps both space and light and this can be modelled mathematically as well as by realistic representation. This essay goes ahead and show how this can be done using Python for the physics simulation and Blender for the visualization. 
 Python Simulation: Gravitational Lensing 
 When it comes to black hole visualization, the phenomenon that industry insiders call gravitational lensing is how light curves around a massive body on account of gravitation. It is possible to simulate the gravitational lensing technique with the help of Python programming language where numerical computations were made using the NumPy library and graphical outputs were done with the help of Matplotlib library. 

The code starts with the definition of main constants such as Gravitational constant (G), mass of the black hole (M) and speed of light (C). These constants are useful in computation of Schwarzschild radius (Rs), the boundary at which matter and light cannot escape from the black hole and commonly referred to as the event horizon. 
Subsequently, several points in space are generated by converting the previous arrays by NumPy linspace and mesh grid commands, the space around the black hole. The lensing effect is then determined by the lensing effect function. The final lensing effect is then obtained. Regarding the light bending function, this function closely simulates how light bends as it approaches the black hole depending on the distance at which this happens known as the event horizon. Last but not least, the Matplotlib library is employed in creating 2D heat map of the lensing of space around the black hole in which space appears “warped” when light passes through it. 
Blender: 3D Visualization of a Black Hole
While Python provides the base for the mathematical aspects of the simulation, Blender is used to create a realistically visual 3D model of the black hole. Blender's tremendous ability in 3D modelling, backed by its Python API, allows modelling structures like an event horizon and accretion disk basically, the ring of light-emitting gas and matter orbiting the black hole.

The first line clears Blender's default cube to make way for the new objects. The script then creates a UV sphere, which is to act as the event horizon of the black hole. It will be coloured black to simulate the visual effect of light not coming from the surface of a black hole.
The next step is to create a torus for the accretion disk—the light-emitting, sometimes visible, ring orbiting the black hole. Use Blender's Node system to give this torus an emitting material to emulate its glow, as often depicted in artistic representations of black holes. This emission material lights up the accretion disk, so that it appears to be shining from within, occasionally adding an air of realism to the imagery. Final results can then be rendered in order to achieve realistic lighting effects using the Cycles render engine from Blender, thus improving the means of visualization.
